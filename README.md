## Description

**A Simple To-Do App Mainly Written In Javascript**

**The project structure is kinda like React and inspired by React style because we only have a `root` element in the HTML and everything else is injected by Javascript, basically Javascript has the responsibility of the DOM manipulation over the entire project**

> âš Alert: The app has browser compatibility issues as I've noticed, especially on mobile browsers and if you are not using the latest versions of the browser the app may not work properly or not working at all.
