# To-Do_App

A Simple To-Do App Mainly Written In Javascript.

**You Can See The Project Live On:** [Here](https://amirhoseinhesami.github.io/To-Do_App/)

*The project structure is kinda like React and inspired by react style because we only have a `root` element in the HTML and everything else is injected by javascript, basically javascript has the responsibility of the DOM manipulation over the entire project*

> âš  Alert: The app has browser compatibility issues as i've noticed, especially on mobile browsers
